Hello and warm welcome! Thank you for visiting me. 
I'm Jijia, and this is my space to share interests, work and future ideas. 
I'm currently a PhD student at Friedrich-Schiller Universität Jena, and working on machine learning for mental healthcare.
In my spare time I enjoy good films, travelling and knitting, and I really wish to pick up tennis and bouldering this year!
Feel free to reach out to me via [email](jxing3006@outlook.com).
